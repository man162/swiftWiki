//  What -> Abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user
//  In swift we can achieve abstraction by protocols
//  Why -> To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.

import Foundation

protocol Animal {
    func makeSound ()
}

// by conforming to protocol we must have to provide the implementation for makeSound() function

class Dog : Animal {
    func makeSound() {
        print("Boo boo")
    }
}

class Cat: Animal {

    func makeSound() {
        print("meeewaoo meewaao !!")
    }

}

// Protcol Extensions
// How -> Simple Extend the protocol by adding methods and computed properties.
// Why -> Instead of implementing behavior on conforming types we can define that on protocol. ^_^ hide those from outside
// +++ -> Default Implementation as function or computed properties defined by protocol extension do no need to be implemented by conforming types.
